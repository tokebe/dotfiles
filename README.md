# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles. Like any user, my setup is idiosyncratic at best, so bare with me.

## Installation

My dotfiles are managed using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). This *should* make things relatively simple.

### Quick installation

If you're lazy, just use this oneliner:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokebe/dotfiles/main/quick)"
```

### Normal Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tokebe/dotfiles.git
```

Install:

```bash
cd dotfiles && ./install
```

Anyone who deserves thanking, they'll go here.
