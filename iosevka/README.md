# Iosevka Tokebe

Nothing special, just my custom configurations + nerd font patched (complete, windows compatible, height-adjusted)

I've added the original license from Iosevka since I'm caching actual font files. Hopefully that's alright. If not, please contact me and I'll do what I can to make things right.
